# simple-blackjack-python-project
This is my simple project from the python courses "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu

As a beginner, I manage to finish the project without using any hints and only using my knowlegde of blackjack and basics python.
The project itself doesn't really similar to the blackjack game, which does not have splitting card, double the bet, the betting itself, and etc.
I'm happy that I can do the project without any hints or help from people or even AI :D
